Observe that the parents of e are b and c, whereas\n * d and f each only have one parent. Each row is complete and will never be missing\n * a node. So each row has one more NumberTriangle object than the row above it.\n *\n *                  a\n *                b   c\n *              d   e   f\n *            h   i   j   k\n *\n * Also note that this data structure is minimally defined and is only intended to\n * be constructed using the loadTriangle method, which you will implement\n * in this file. We have not included any code to enforce the structure noted above,\n * and you don't have to write any either.\n *\n *\n * See NumberTriangleTest.java for a few basic test cases.\n *\n * Extra: If you decide to solve the Project Euler problems (see main),\n *        feel free to add extra methods to this class. Just make sure that your\n *        code still compiles and runs so that we can run the tests on your code.\n *\n */\npublic class NumberTriangle {\n\n    private int root;\n\n    private NumberTriangle left;\n    private NumberTriangle right;\n\n    public NumberTriangle(int root) {\n        this.root = root;\n    }\n\n    public void setLeft(NumberTriangle left) {\n        this.left = left;\n    }\n\n    public void setRight(NumberTriangle right) {\n        this.right = right;\n    }\n\n    public int getRoot() {\n        return root;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * [not for credit]\n     * Set the root of this NumberTriangle to be the max path sum\n     * of this NumberTriangle, as defined in Project Euler problem 18.\n     * After this method is called, this NumberTriangle should be a leaf.\n     *\n     * Hint: think recursively and use the idea of partial tracing from first year :)\n     *\n     * Note: a NumberTriangle contains at least one value.\n     */\n    public void maxSumPath() {\n        // for fun [not for credit]:\n    }\n\n\n    public boolean isLeaf() {\n        return right == null && left == null;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * Follow path through this NumberTriangle structure ('l' = left; 'r' = right) and\n     * return the root value at the end of the path.
